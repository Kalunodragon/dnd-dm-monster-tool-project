# D&D Monster Tool

The D&D Monster Tool is a project to help DM's organize monsters they have for a specific encounter.

## How to use

To add Monster cards to the selection area, simply click on the add monster button within the card. To remove a monster simply click the Remove Monster button from the added card. My initial thoughts was to have this be used as a quick refference for Monsters while in the middle of a D&D session.

The search bar allows a few features:

Search for a specific monster: Use that monsters name

Search for monsters that start with a specific letter: Search just that letter

After a search if you want to bring all the Monster cards back into view, simply submit an empty search and they will all reappear!

## Installation

Fork and clone this code down to your machine using git clone within your terminal.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Kalunodragon/dnd-dm-monster-tool-project.git
```

## How to open

Open the index.html file from within the directory after the git clone. Use your terminal command for opening the file.

WSL Ubuntu
```bash
explorer.exe index.html
```
Mac OS
```bash
open index.html
```

## Project Status

This is the End of Phase 1 project for Flatirons School. For now there will be minor updates. There may be a portion of time before I come back and continue adding additional features.
